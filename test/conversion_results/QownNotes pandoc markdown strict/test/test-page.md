Below is a link to a page that has a duplicated page title

[This is a duplicated title](../test-book-2/this-is-a-duplicated-title.md)

An audio memo recording has been attached - it is silent because Note Station does not record correctly on my computers (if the feature actually works) but this shows it is exported.

An example-attachment.pdf has been attached

This page has 4 tags Tag1, Tag2, Tag1/SubTag1, Tag1/SubTag1/SubSubTag1. There will be near the top of the markdown file.

This is some code pasted into the note

    if not files_to_convert:
        print('No .nsx files found')
        exit(1)

There is no way to insert 'code' in line in a Note.  Note formatted HTML does not use the &lt;code&gt; tag it just uses a &lt;pre&gt; tag so code is always it's own block even if only one word. Just like

    while

this.

A pdf of what this page looks like in Note Station has been attached - see test page.pdf

This is the end of the text.
