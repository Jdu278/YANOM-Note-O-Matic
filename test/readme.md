OK so there is no proper testing yet..

- The test.nsx file is a synology note station export file.  It has two notebooks, and some notes in the recycle bin.
- Inside the export file a notebook called test has a note called 'test page'.  This page has an example of each feature available in synology Note-Station notes.
- The pdf file ```test page.pdf``` is  what the page looks like in note station, well it's what it looks like when note station does a poor job of printing notes :-).
- The folder ```current_output_md_gfm```  has a git flavoured markdown (gfm) output set to the current progress of writing.
- The folder ```current_output_html```  has a html export to the current progress of writing.
