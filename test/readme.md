OK so there is no proper testing yet..

- The test.nsx file is a synology note station export file.  It has two notebooks, and some notes in the recycle bin.
- Inside the export file a notebook called ```test``` has a note called 'test page'.  This page has an example of each feature available in Synology Note-Station notes.
- The pdf file ```test page.pdf``` is what the page looks like in note station.
- The folder ```current_results```  has sub folders for each of the curren 'quick settings' outputs.  Using the interactive command line each of these can be modified individually.
